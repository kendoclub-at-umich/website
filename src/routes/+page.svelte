<h2>What is Kendo?</h2>
<p>
	Kendo is a Japanese martial art which literally translates to “The Way of the Sword”. It's an
	athletic sport which is played by means of one-on-one striking between opponents using shinai
	(sword made from bamboo slats) while wearing kendo-gu (protective armor).
</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>
	Kendo Club at the University of Michigan is led by students and instructed by highly experienced
	coaches. Our purpose is to provide an open and inviting opportunity for University of Michigan
	students and local community members to learn and practice Kendo. We invite everyone of any skill
	level to join us!
</p>

<h2>How do you join?</h2>

<h3>Come to practice!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No prior experience needed!</li>
	<li>
		You may join any practice session you like (though you may find it easier to join closer to the
		beginning of a new semester, as there are larger groups of complete beginners).
	</li>
	<li>Find our up-to-date practice schedule in the <a href="/calendar">Calendar</a> page.</li>
	<li>
		Please wear comfortable athletic clothes. Wear bottoms that cover the knee because there is some
		kneeling involved. Kendo is a barefoot sport, so please leave your shoes outside the ballroom
		before entering.
	</li>
	<li>Masking is optional. Surgical or cloth masks are the best choices for breathability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Dues: A fee is charged per semester to cover room booking. Your first two practices are free.
	</li>
	<li>
		Equipment: For your first two practices, you may borrow a shinai (bamboo sword) from any club
		member who graciously lends it to you. Afterwards, you will be offered the opportunity to
		purchase your own equipment depending on what we have in stock. One shinai is about $30, and a
		carrying bag is about $20.
	</li>
	<li>
		Gym Membership: You are required to have a Umich rec sports membership. If you are a student
		taking at least one class this term, it is included in your tuition. If you are a non-student,
		consider multi-day passes or a membership. Whichever one is more economical depends on how often
		you plan on joining practice. See the
		<a href="https://recsports.umich.edu/fitness/"> rec sports website </a> for more details.
