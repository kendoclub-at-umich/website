<details>
	<summary>It looks dangerous, will I get hurt or injured?</summary>
	<p>
		As with any sports, there is some level of risk involved. But in general, injuries are quite
		rare for Kendo players. Our bamboo sword (shinai) and armor (bogu) are designed to absorb
		impact, and have been perfected for over 300 years. If your opponent misses the correct target,
		it can sting a little.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you put on bogu, we will teach you how to protect yourself and others from accidental
		harm. It is an important part of Kendo to fight with respect and gratitude instead of with
		muscle and anger, so Kendo players always put their opponents’ safety prior to winning a
		sparing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Safety routine in kendo training includes regular inspection of shinai and bogu, proper
		stretching before practice, etc.

	<summary>Is Kendo an expensive hobby?</summary>
	<p>In general, the cost of practicing Kendo includes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Club dues and gym pass (see home page).</li>
		<li>
			AUSKF membership (<a href="https://www.auskf.org/">https://www.auskf.org/</a>):<br />
			The AUSKF (All United States Kendo Federation) membership is ~ $80 per year. Students get discount.
			Beginners do not need to pay until putting on bogu.
		</li>
		<li>
			Promotion test fees and tournament fees:<br />
			As a reference, in 2024, for Kyu test it’s around $40 (test) + $30 (certificate); for 1-Dan (black
			belt entry level) it’s around $50 (test) + $50 (certificate). It goes higher for higher ranks.
			Tournament registration fee varies, typically $30 - $70.
		</li>
		<li>
			Shinai (bamboo sword) and bokuto (wooden sword):<br />
			Depending on practice frequency, a shinai ($30 - $60) can last several months (4-12 month). There
			are ways to reduce the cost by combining orders to get discounts, or making franken-shinai with
			the intact slats from broken shinais. Bokken (~ $50 and up) is only need for promotion test and
			typically never breaks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bogu (armor):<br />
			Bogu is probably <strong>the most expensive component</strong>, but it can last decades with
			good maintenance. A good beginner set can be ~ $400 and up. Always ask around as our
			instructors and senior members might have discount information for some vendors. Also, our
			club might have loaner bogu sets for rent.<br />
			<br />
			Beginners will not wear bogu until they have learned some solid fundamentals, so you don’t need
			to worry about this in the beginning.
		</li>
	</ol>

<details>
	<summary>Where do I buy a bogu set and how do I find the right size of it?</summary>
	<p>
		Consult the instructors first (you need their approval for wearing bogu anyway), they will help
		you with the measurements and direct you to some bogu vendors that we have had good experience
		with. Depending on the order, the club might have shortcode discount or could arrange group
		orders.
	</p>
</details>

<hr />

<details>
	<summary>Do you use real swords?</summary>
	<p>
		No. Kendo uses 2 types of swords: (1) the bamboo sword (shinai) for general practice and
		competition, (2) the wooden sword (bokuto) to more closely approximate the shape and weight of a
		sword when practicing forms (Kata).
	</p>
	<p>
		During some Kata demonstrations we may use metal swords, but because of the possibility of
		injury this is not common.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Do you go to competitions/tournaments?</summary>
	<p>
		Yes. Kendo is a martial art with an active competition component, and tournament is one of the
		best ways to meet Kendo friends. Our club members compete in 3-4 tournaments per year in local
		areas. Our awesome student officers also organize an internal tournament within our club every
		year!
	</p>

<details>
	<summary>Do Kendo instructors get paid?</summary>
	<p>
		No. Our instructors teach us as volunteers. Dues collected by our student officers are for room
		booking and social activities in the club.
	</p>
</details>

<hr />

<details>
	<summary>Do I need to be able to speak Japanese?</summary>
	<p>
		No. Although there are Japanese terms in Kendo, we teach in English. You will become familiar
		with the use of Japanese terms over time with repetition.
	</p>

	<summary>
		How long will it take to earn a black belt and beyond? How to get rank in Kendo?
	</summary>
	<p>
		Kendo uses a Kyu/Dan ranking system. Adult Kendo leaners start from 2 Kyu or 1 Kyu, then advance
		to Dan ranks. Although Dan ranks are considered “black belts”, we do not wear belts or any other
		outward sign of ranking.
	</p>
	<p>
		The time to get ranks depending on your dedication and availability. The first stage is to
		develop fundamentals, which may take weeks or months. The second stage is to put on bogu and get
		used to it. Once you are able to perform good fundamentals in bogu, you will get permission from
		our instructors to test for Kyu. The third stage is to perfect your fundamentals, learn advance
		techniques, and work towards your first Dan rank.
	</p>
	<p>
		It commonly takes 1-2 semesters to put on bogu, no less than 2 years of regular practice to
		reach 1 Dan. There is a mandatory waiting period for dan ranks that increases for each new
		level. 1 Dan to 2 Dan is a 1 year wait, 2 Dan to 3 Dan is a 2 year wait, 3 Dan to 4 Dan is a 3
		year wait and so on.
	</p>

<details>
	<summary>I have no experience, nor am I really physically fit. Will that be a problem?</summary>
	<p>
		It won’t be a problem. Kendo does not have any distinctions between young or old, men or women,
		athletic or not. As a university club, we are especially dedicated to training beginners.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our practices can be challenging, but they will always also be self-paced for safety. Keep an
		open mind as you will find your physical limitations challenged, but you will decide how far you
		wish to push you own limits.
	</p>

<details>
	<summary>
		I have a high ranking belt in another martial art, can it be transferred to Kendo?
	</summary>
	<p>
		Although many martial arts share similar fundamentals, you will start at a similar introduction
		level in Kendo. Your training in other martial arts might help you advance faster in Kendo.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you come from a Kumdo background, you may be considered to hold a comparable rank in Kendo.
		Please talk with the instructors and bring documentation of your current rank for verification.
