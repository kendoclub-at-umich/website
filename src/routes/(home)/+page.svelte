<h2>What is Kendo?</h2>
<p>
	Kendo is a Japanese martial art which literally translates to “The Way of the Sword”. It is an
	athletic sport which is played by means of one-on-one striking between opponents using shinai
	(sword made from bamboo slats) while wearing kendo-gu (protective armor).

<h2>How do you join?</h2>

<h3>Come to practice!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No prior experience needed!</li>
	<li>
		You may join any practice session you like (though you may find it easier to join closer to the
		beginning of a new semester when there are larger groups of complete beginners).
	</li>
	<li>Find our up-to-date practice schedule in the <a href="/calendar">Calendar</a> page.</li>
	<li>
		Please wear comfortable athletic clothes. Wear pants that cover the knee because there is some
		kneeling involved. Kendo is a barefoot sport, so please leave your shoes outside the ballroom
		before entering.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Dues: A fee is charged per semester to cover room booking. Your first two practices are free.
	</li>
	<li>
		Equipment: For your first two practices, you may borrow a shinai (bamboo sword) from a club
		member. Afterwards, you will be offered the opportunity to purchase your own equipment depending
		on what's in stock. One shinai is about $30, and a carrying bag is about $20.
	</li>
	<li>
		Gym Membership: You are required to have a Umich rec sports membership. If you are a student
		taking at least one class, it is included in your tuition. If you are a non-student, consider a
		multi-day pass or a membership, depending on how often you plan on joining practice. See the
		<a href="https://recsports.umich.edu/fitness/"> rec sports website </a> for more details.
	</li>
