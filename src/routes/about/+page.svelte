<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
	Kendo Club at the University of Michigan was founded in the fall of 2001 and officially recognized
	by the Midwest Kendo Federation (MWKF) in the fall of 2002. Instruction of our club was originally
	lead by Chika and Takashi Ezaki. Once they returned to Japan in 2003, instruction transitioned to
	Yukio Watanabe and Joe Ponchart. After the groundwork was laid out for a consistent practice space
	at the University of Michigan, cross training with
	<a href="https://www.seishinkankendo.com/">Seishinkan Kendo</a> in Ypsilanti (formerly Eastern Kendo
	Club) continued. Our shared history reaffirms our continued partnership as both clubs seek to advance
	and promote the practice of Kendo in the Midwest. Many of our instructors and members continue to train
	at both locations.
</p>
<p>
	Our club is classified as a student organization through the Michigan Student Assembly, the
	student government of the University of Michigan. Our Kendo Club is also part of the
	<a href="https://www.midwestkendofederation.org/">Midwest Kendo Federation (MWKF)</a>, which is
	the regional chapter under the
	<a href="https://www.auskf.org/">All United States Kendo Federation (AUSKF)</a>, the national
	governing body for Kendo. The MWKF is responsible for all Kendo clubs and Dojos in the Midwest
	area.

<h2>Motto</h2>

<p class="motto">心技一体</p>

<p>
	Our club motto reads "Shin Gi Ittai", which translates approximately to "The Spirit and Skill are
	One Body" or "The Heart and Technique are Together". This motto was one of several proposed by
	Masaki Hori in the fall of 2004, and was chosen by our club officers and coaches to best represent
	the ideals we strive for in our club. This motto is on our club tenugui (cloth head wrap worn
	under helmet), which are traditionally given to club members before their first competition as a
	sign of mutual support and encouragement.
</p>

<h2>Constitution</h2>
